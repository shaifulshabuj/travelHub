# Multi-Agent Context Engineering Templates

## Agent Specialization Framework

This directory contains the context and DNA templates for each specialized agent in the TravelHub ecosystem. Each agent has specific responsibilities, genetic traits, and evolution strategies.

## Agent Structure

### 1. Architecture Agent
- **Role**: System Architect & Pattern Designer
- **Responsibilities**: Design patterns, architectural decisions, system evolution
- **Genetic Traits**: SOLID principles, microservice patterns, clean architecture

### 2. Backend Agent  
- **Role**: Spring Boot Microservices Developer
- **Responsibilities**: Business logic, REST APIs, data persistence, security
- **Genetic Traits**: Spring Boot practices, JPA/MongoDB patterns, security implementations

### 3. Frontend Agent
- **Role**: React/TypeScript UI Developer
- **Responsibilities**: UI components, state management, performance optimization
- **Genetic Traits**: React hooks evolution, TypeScript interfaces, responsive design

### 4. Database Agent
- **Role**: Data Architecture & Schema Designer
- **Responsibilities**: Schema design, query optimization, data consistency
- **Genetic Traits**: Normalization principles, NoSQL design, indexing strategies

### 5. DevOps Agent
- **Role**: Infrastructure & Deployment Manager
- **Responsibilities**: Container orchestration, CI/CD, monitoring
- **Genetic Traits**: Kubernetes manifests, pipeline templates, security patterns

### 6. Testing Agent
- **Role**: Quality Assurance & Test Automation
- **Responsibilities**: Test creation, automation, performance testing
- **Genetic Traits**: Test pyramid principles, mock patterns, assertion strategies

## Evolution Principles

### Inheritance
- Base templates inherited by specialized implementations
- Best practices propagated across generations
- Pattern consistency maintained through genetic lineage

### Mutation
- Performance-driven adaptations
- Security enhancements based on threat landscape
- User feedback integration

### Crossover
- Successful patterns shared between agents
- Cross-pollination of solutions
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple strategies

### Selection
- Fitness-based component selection
- Natural elimination of inefficient patterns
- Survival of the most adaptable solutions
